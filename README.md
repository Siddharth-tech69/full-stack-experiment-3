# problem:-
# ProductCard Component Using Props
Create a React component named ProductCard that accepts props for product name, price, and stock status. The component should display all three details clearly, for example in a card layout or a simple styled box. You should demonstrate how different product data can be passed into the component and rendered dynamically without changing the component code.


# Library Management UI with Search, Add, and Remove Book Functionality
Create a React-based UI that displays a list of books (each with a title and author). Add a search input box to filter books by title or author as the user types. Provide an input form to add new books to the list, and include a remove button next to each book to delete it from the list. All actions (searching, adding, removing) should work dynamically without reloading the page, demonstrating React's ability to update the UI based on state changes.


# Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses
Create a base Person class that has properties like name and age, and a method to display basic information. Then, create two subclasses: Student and Teacher, each extending Person. The Student class should include an additional property like grade or course, and the Teacher class should include a property like subject or department. Each subclass should override or extend methods as needed to display complete details. Finally, create instances of both subclasses and demonstrate calling their methods to show how inheritance and method overriding work.
